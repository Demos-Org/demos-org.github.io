        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Thousands of taxpayer-subsidized companies, including the country’s largest corporations, can spend unlimited amounts of money to elect the Congress members who oversee the contracting process, and they can do it secretly. Those same companies have lobbied to prevent raising the federal minimum wage, disproportionately affecting women and people of color who currently earn far too little to support themselves or their families.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>We can do something now. While he can’t get all of the secret money out of the presidential race, the President can make contractors fully disclose their political spending by signing an executive order to make taxpayer-funded federal contractors accountable for their political spending.</b><br> </p><br>

        <p class="lead">Ask the President to set a higher standard for disclosure. Tell him to issue an order ensuring companies that get our tax dollars don't hide their political spending.</p>
